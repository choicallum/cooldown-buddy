# Cooldown Buddy
Hi! I'm Callum Choi, a student at the University of Waterloo who is passionate about games. I developed Cooldown Buddy as a tool for League of Legends players to quickly and easily find the cooldowns of allies and enemies.

# Installation
As of Version 0.1, as a work in progress initial release, installation is a bit difficult right now.

First, download Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/), and the cd_grabber.py file. 

Follow set-up instructions and click "New file +". From there, click the blue "Select a language" and select Python, and follow set-up instructions for Python.

Import the cd_grabber.py by clicking "Open file" and finding where the cd_grabber.py file is located.

Then, press Ctrl + \` to open the terminal. Input "pip install requests".

From there, click the Run button in the top left!

# Tech Stack Used

# Features to add
Make the application easier to install, and easier to use (GUI)

# Closing Notes
Although a work in progress, I did learn a lot about both Python and RESTful APIs getting this project to this stage, and I hope to learn more! Thanks for checking this out.
